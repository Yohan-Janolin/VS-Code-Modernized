**Elevate your Visual Studio Code experience!**
VS Code Modernized V2 applies a sleek, custom UI redesign, going beyond standard themes by offering customizable spacing, rounded corners, and a refined dark aesthetic. By applying custom CSS and JavaScript, it provides a more polished and visually appealing development environment.

## Features

- Applies a custom, modern UI theme with rounded corners, shadows, etc.
- Includes the 'Deep Blue Modern' theme, which is applied by default for the best visual experience.
- Enhances the command palette appearance and behavior to match the modern theme.
- Provides commands to easily enable or disable the custom styles.
- **Completely Open Source:** Available on GitHub under the MIT license. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or report issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yohan-Janolin/VS-Code-Modernized-v2).

## Preview

Either let the extension do the work for you and set the Deep Blue Modern color theme automatically...

Or, disable the default behavior using the `vscode-modernized.autoApplyTheme` setting (see [configuration](#configuration)), so that the extension uses the theme of your choice.

## Installation

**Note:** This extension works best with the included **'Deep Blue Modern'** theme. While the custom styles might work with other themes, the visual appearance might not be optimal.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have VS Code installed (tested with v1.138.0+, might also work on other versions).
    <!-- *   *(Optional but Recommended)* Install the [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font/mono) font for the intended look. -->
2.  **Install the Extension:**
    - **From VSIX (Manual):** Download the `.vsix` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Yohan-Janolin/VS-Code-Modernized-v2/releases) page. Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), click the `...` menu, select "Install from VSIX...", and choose the downloaded file.
    - **⚠️ Note:** If you uninstall this extension later, you MUST run the `VS Code Modernized V2: Remove Styles` command first. See the [important note](#%EF%B8%8F-important-note) section for details.
3.  **Apply Styles:**
    - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    - Use the command: `VS Code Modernized V2: Apply Styles` (type to search if necessary).
    - If prompted, grant administrative privileges.
    - VS Code might ask to reload; if not, restart VS Code or manually reload the window (`Ctrl + R`).
    - Dismiss the "corrupt installation" warning if it appears (see [important note](#%EF%B8%8F-important-note) section below).
    - By default, the extension will also switch your color theme to 'Deep Blue Modern' for the optimal visual experience. You can disable this behavior in the settings (see [configuration](#configuration)).

## Usage

### Commands

Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) to access the following commands:

| Command                          | Title                             | Description                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vscode-modernized-v2.applyStyles`  | VS Code Modernized V2: Apply Styles  | Applies the custom styles to VS Code.                                                                    |
| `vscode-modernized-v2.removeStyles` | VS Code Modernized V2: Remove Styles | Removes the custom styles from VS Code, reverting to default. (Does not automatically revert the theme). | 

### Reverting Changes

To remove the custom styles completely:

1.  Run the command `VS Code Modernized V2: Remove Styles`.
2.  If prompted, grant administrative privileges.
3.  Reload or restart VS Code.

## Configuration

This extension provides the following configuration setting (accessible via `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for `VS Code Modernized`):

- **`vscode-modernized-v2.autoApplyTheme`**: (Default: `true`)

  - When enabled, the extension automatically applies the 'Deep Blue Modern' theme when you run the `Apply Styles` command.
  - Disable this if you want to use the custom UI styles with your own preferred color theme.

- **`vscode-modernized-v2.ui.spacing`**: (Default: `0.35rem`)

  - Controls the general spacing used for margins and padding around UI elements (e.g., sidebar, editor group).
  - Use positive CSS units like `rem`, `px`, `em` (e.g., '0.5rem', '10px').
  - **Warning:** Setting extreme values might negatively impact usability or make VS Code difficult to use.

- **`vscode-modernized-v2.ui.borderRadius`**: (Default: `0.5rem`)

  - Controls the roundness of corners for elements like tabs, sidebar, panels, buttons, and inputs.
  - Use positive CSS units like `rem`, `px`, `em` (e.g., '0.5rem', '8px').
  - **Warning:** Setting extreme values might negatively impact usability or make VS Code difficult to use.

- **`vscode-modernized-v2.ui.tabSpacing`**: (Default: `0.2rem`)
  - Controls the spacing between editor tabs.
  - Use positive CSS units like `rem`, `px`, `em` (e.g., '0.2rem', '4px').
  - **Warning:** Setting extreme values might negatively impact usability or make VS Code difficult to use.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This extension modifies VS Code's files (mainly `workbench.html`) to apply/inject the custom styles. This is an unsupported method by Microsoft and might break with future VS Code updates.

- After applying the styles, VS Code will likely show a **"Your Code installation appears to be corrupt. Please reinstall."** warning. This is expected because a core file was modified. You can safely dismiss this warning by clicking the gear icon on the notification and selecting "Don't Show Again".
- Due to this, the extension may require **administrative privileges** (sudo/run as administrator) to write the necessary changes to the VS Code installation directory.
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Before uninstalling or disabling this extension, you MUST run the `VS Code Modernized V2: Remove Styles` command to revert the modifications made to VS Code's files. Failing to do so will leave the styles enabled in VS Code until you re-install the extension and disable/remove them.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

- **Q: VS Code says my installation is corrupt!**
  - A: This is expected. See the **Important Note** section above. You can safely ignore it.
- **Q: Styles didn't apply after running the command.**
  - A: Ensure you granted administrative privileges if prompted. Try restarting VS Code completely or reloading the window (`Ctrl + R`).
- **Q: The extension broke after a VS Code update.**
  - A: This is possible, as the styles injection method is not officially supported. Try running `VS Code Modernized V2: Remove Styles`, then `VS Code Modernized V2: Apply Styles` again. If it still fails, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Yohan-Janolin/VS-Code-Modernized-v2/issues).
